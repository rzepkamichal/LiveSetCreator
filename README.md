# LiveSetCreator

This application is meant to be a usefull tool for live bands, especially cover bands.
Its' main purpose is to create an interactive set of songs (including lyrics, parameters and useful notes for the live performers) for the next on-stage show-up. So, during a break, the performer can easily pick some songs from the band's library for the next gig and slightly switch between them.

The idea came up, after using PowerPoint or Impress for this purpose. These apps are fine for making presentations but they seem to be sluggish when it comes to using them on live music performances.

In the future, more live band - supporting features are meant to be added.
