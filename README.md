# SetCreator

This Application is meant to be a usefull tool for live bands, especially cover bands.
Its' main purpose is to create an interactive set of songs (including lyrics, parameters and useful notes for the live performance) for the next on-stage show-up. So, during a break, the performer can easily pick some songs from the band's library for the next gig and slightly switch between them.

The idea came up, after using for this purpose PowerPoint or Impress. These apps are fine for making presentation but they seem to be sluggish when using on live music performances.

In the future, more live band - supporting features are meant to be added.
